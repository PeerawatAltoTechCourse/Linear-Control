R: The residues of the partial fraction expansion. It is a column vector containing the complex residue values corresponding to each pole of the rational function. The residues are ordered according to the order of the poles in the transfer function.

P: The poles of the rational function. It is a column vector containing the complex pole values. The poles are ordered in the same way as the corresponding residues in R.

K: The direct term or polynomial term of the partial fraction expansion. It is a scalar representing the constant value or polynomial term in the partial fraction expansion.
